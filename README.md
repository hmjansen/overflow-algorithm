# overflow-algorithm
An efficient algorithm to solve traffic equations related to queueing networks with buffer overflows.

This repository is related to the paper Traffic Equations for Fluid Networks with Overflows, which is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09611v1) on arXiv.

The file overflow_algorithm.py contains a direct implementation of the main algorithm in the paper (Algorithm 2).

To reproduce the examples in the paper, download the files to a folder and run the file experiments.py under Python 3. See the documentation of the files for more information.
